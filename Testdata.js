Dogs raise their hackles, cats hiss and run, and despite their best efforts, even close family members find you unsettling. Finally, on your birthday, you learn why."

You don't know how to explain that you misunderstood their request to 'train in the badlands', and have instead created a safe, lucrative railway network through the savage territory."

They piled stones on top of one another and built curious objects out of sticks and metal. One draconian scholar is searching to uncover the mystery of their disappearance."

                    title: "[WP] Being a faceless goon is a cushy job. Evil lairs, hostages, death rays, but the heroes always escape and save the day, so no harm, no foul, right? But today, the heroes aren’t escaping, and they still aren’t escaping, and… it’s beginning to dawn on you that your boss might actually succeed."

In the name of unimaginable wealth, you begin your quest to build the world's strongest most fireproof Triple Superking size bed."

Realizing there are no living souls in the North Pole there is only one thing you can do. YOU must become Santa and save Christmas."
